Adds a search box to the top of the WordPress Admin Menu. Admin Menu Search allows you to easily locate menu items on sites with lots of menu items. 

== Description ==

Admin Menu Search is a simple plugin that adds a search box to the top of the Admin Menu in the WordPress Dashboard. No more scrolling up and down or using your browser's Ctrl+F or Find function to locate menu items.

Just enter a few characters in the Search Menus field and the Admin Menu will be trimmed down to only the items that match your search.

Submenus are also included in the search, so if you're looking for "Widgets" it will keep the "Appearance" menu in the list because Widgets lives under Appearance / Widgets.
